# Requirements Document: Learning Module for Functions in Python

## Introduction

This document outlines the learning requirements for the "Functions in Python" module. Functions are a fundamental building block for writing reusable, organized, and maintainable code. Mastering them is essential for any Python developer.

## Requirements

### 1. Function Definition and Invocation

**Learning Story:** As a learner, I want to understand the basic syntax for creating and executing a function, so that I can start writing modular code.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  GIVEN a valid block of Python code, WHEN I define a function using the `def` keyword, a function name, parentheses, and a colon, THEN a function object SHALL be created.
2.  GIVEN a defined function, WHEN I call it by its name followed by parentheses, THEN the code block within that function SHALL be executed.

### 2. Parameters and Arguments

**Learning Story:** As a learner, I want to learn how to pass data into functions, so that they can operate on different inputs and be more flexible.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  GIVEN a function defined with parameters, WHEN I call it and provide values (arguments), THEN those values SHALL be accessible via the parameter names inside the function.
2.  GIVEN a function with default parameter values, WHEN I call it without providing an argument for that parameter, THEN the function SHALL use the default value.

### 3. Return Values

**Learning Story:** As a learner, I want to get data back from a function, so that I can use the result of its computation in other parts of my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  GIVEN a function that includes a `return` statement with a value, WHEN the function is called, THEN it SHALL evaluate to that value.
2.  GIVEN a function without a `return` statement, WHEN it is called, THEN it SHALL implicitly return `None`.

### 4. Function Scope and Variable Lifetime

**Learning Story:** As a learner, I want to understand variable scope within functions, so that I can avoid naming conflicts and manage variable lifetimes correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  GIVEN a function with local variables, WHEN the function executes, THEN those variables SHALL only be accessible within the function's scope.
2.  GIVEN a function that accesses global variables, WHEN the function executes, THEN it SHALL be able to read and modify those global variables using the `global` keyword.

### 5. Function Documentation and Best Practices

**Learning Story:** As a learner, I want to learn how to write clean, documented functions, so that my code is maintainable and follows Python best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  GIVEN a function definition, WHEN I add a docstring, THEN the function SHALL have proper documentation accessible via the `help()` function.
2.  GIVEN a function, WHEN I choose descriptive names for the function and its parameters, THEN the code SHALL be more readable and self-documenting.

### 6. Advanced Function Concepts

**Learning Story:** As a learner, I want to understand advanced function features, so that I can write more flexible and powerful code.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  GIVEN a function, WHEN I define it with `*args`, THEN it SHALL accept any number of positional arguments.
2.  GIVEN a function, WHEN I define it with `**kwargs`, THEN it SHALL accept any number of keyword arguments.
3.  GIVEN a function definition, WHEN I use lambda syntax, THEN I SHALL be able to create small anonymous functions.
